# Regression-Techniques
The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the understanding of regression techniques in supervised learning by applying them to a real-world dataset.
Dataset: The dataset used is the California Housing dataset available in the sklearn library. This dataset contains information about various features of houses in California and their respective median prices.

Key Components Fulfilled:

Loading and Preprocessing :

Loaded the California Housing dataset using the fetch_california_housing function from sklearn. Converted the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling. Handled missing values (if any) and performed necessary feature scaling (e.g., standardization).

Regression Algorithm Implementation:

Implemented the following regression algorithms:

Linear Regression Decision Tree Regressor Random Forest Regressor Gradient Boosting Regressor Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Model Evaluation and Comparison :

Evaluated the performance of each algorithm using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) R-squared Score (RÂ²)
